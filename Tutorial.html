            <h1>&#128377;Welcome to Game Development&#128377;</h1>
       
        <p> Game development has exploded over the last few years, and now it seems like everyone is making a video game. You've got big studios full of hundreds of people. You've got small teams making incredible games. 
            There are more people in independent game development than ever. This is an amazing thing, because everyone brings their unique experience and sensibilities to game design.

            The more people who we can get making games and sharing their individual voices, the more we will see games evolve in new and exciting directions.
            
            Believe it or not, this can involve you.
            
            Do you have an idea for a game you wish you could play rolling around in your head? And no one is making it? I've got good news for you: 
            there are more tools and support than ever to help people who have no experience with coding or development start to learn how to create the games of their dreams. If no one is making what you want to play, why not learn how to make it yourself?</p>
        
            <p><h1>Start small, and be ready to fail.</h1>
            Before you get too excited, please realize that, as with any other skill, learning how to design and develop games takes time and practice. Your first game won't look like the polished games you're used to playing, much like your first drawing won't come out looking like Monet. This is absolutely fine. My first game has a huge bug in it that causes it to break for about half of its users. I was unable to figure out how to fix it.</p>
        
            <p>You should shoot for what developers call a prototype: a smaller version of your idea with a few working mechanics, a prototype that lets you see how your game plays, allows you to improve the design, and forms the foundation that you can later build upon to make a full game.

            As you make your first game, you will also experience the same thing every other developer has: "feature creep" or issues with scope. You will likely want to put too much into your first gameâ€”too many mechanics, too much content. Your ambition will push your toward any number of traps. This is okay, as long as you fix it or "scope down".
            
            For your first game, distill what you'd like to see into a single mechanic and try to create that one thing. Go with a simple mechanic like "navigate a story by selecting your actions from a menu" or "keep an object from dropping". 
            Think Pong, not Call of Duty. It likely won't be the next big thing, but it will be a prototype, and it will be something you can build on in the future, if you desire. Some specific things you may want to avoid putting in to your first game include multiplayer functions, online scoreboards, or working in 3D.
        </p>


        <p>So you have your idea, distilled down into a manageable, simple game. Now what? This is where those tools I mentioned come into play. There are an enormous variety of them, and more are being created all the time. 
            This guide is primarily for those who have absolutely no computer science skills, have never programmed anything in their life and think that it's beyond their ability to do so.

            The following tools will help you go from no coding or development experience to having finished your first prototype. 
            Most of them come prepackaged with sample games, and one of the best ways to learn a new game development tool is to muck around with them, take them apart, and see how they work.
        </p>

            <h2> Stencyl</h2>
Another recently-created tool, Stencyl has a very user-friendly graphical interface that will help you make a wide variety of games. Stencyl uses a Lego-like approach to coding, where you arrange code "blocks" and snap them into logic statements. If you're starting to get the hang of coding, you can switch to a mode that will let you view and edit the code in these "blocks," allowing you to tweak or even create code from scratch that will work with everything else in the program.

The tool also comes pre-packaged with several sample games, which you can modify to your heart's content. Viewing and editing the code in these blocks is also a way to begin to understand Actionscript3, which you can then apply to making flash games and apps without the aid of Stencyl.

Since Stencyl games are output to a .swf (flash) file, this makes it easy to share your games with others. If you don't have web hosting of your own, you can upload your game to Stencyl's site and share the link from there.

Another advantage of Stencyl is its in-program asset server, which allows you to download and share art assets, code blocks, and even entire games right in Stencyl.

Stencyl does have a few drawbacks. Since the program is relatively new, it's still got a few bugs. A bug I've encountered has erased most of my work, so if you're going to use this tool I highly recommend saving multiple copies of what you're making. Save often. The base program comes free, but the pro version (which offers more customizations and access to private forums) is $79 dollars a year. If you want to port your games to iOS it's another $149 a yea
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>GameMaker</h2>
GameMaker is very similar to Stencyl, but has some key differences. GameMaker's free version only exports to executable files (.exes or .dmgs) with watermarks on them. 
It offers more formats and features if you purchase one of the paid versions (Standard for $49.99, Professional for $99.99, and Master for $499.99). 
GameMaker uses a similar drag-and-drop interface approach to code, but uses its own language that only works in GameMaker. However, GameMaker has been used to produce high-profile indie games such as the original versions of Spelunky and Stealth Bastard.

GameMaker, like Stencyl, has a very useful tutorial that comes packaged with the program. I highly suggest running through it on your first time to get a feel for how things work and how to navigate the interface. 
Once you've done that, YoYo Games has a ton of tutorials that might help you make the specific kind of game you're hoping for. GMLscripts is a wonderful site full of free scripts you can use in your game, and TIGsource has a thread for tutorials and open-source GameMaker games.
